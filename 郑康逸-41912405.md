# 要点阐述——What's an Operating System?
***The Operating System is the whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interact with it.***
## Components of an Operating System
There are two main parts of operating system that Kernal Space and User Space and there are three main operating system used in IT that Windows、Mac and Linux.

## Kernel 
Kernel creates processes,efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated.
### Files and File Systems
#### Three main components of handling files
##### Data
##### Metadata
##### File system
### Process Management
Process is a program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor.
Program is an application that we can run,like Chrome.
A process can execute several programs. 
### Memory Management
Our kernel optimizes meemory usage and makes sure our applications have enough memory to run.
#### virtual memory
It's the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
It's working process:

### I/O Management
I/O Management is how our kernel talks to external devices like disks、keyboards、networks 、connections audio devices and more IO management is anything that can give us input,or that we can use for output of data.
## Interacting with the OS:User Space
There are two ways we can use to interact with our OS with a shell(*program taht interprets text commands and sends them to OS to execute*) or a graphical user interface and we mainly use the Command-line interface or CLI shell that means we will use text commands.
## Logs
Logs are files that record system events on our computer,just like a sysgtem's diary.
## The Boot Process
It means to start from nothing and follow a series of steps to arrive at a fully operational system.
The boot process: \

### BIOS/UEFI
It is a low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go.
### Bootloader
It is a small program that loads the operating system.


```python

```
